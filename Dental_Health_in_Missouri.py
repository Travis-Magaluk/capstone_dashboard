overview = """
Our dashboard presents an analysis spanning from 2010 to 2024, focusing on provider data of dentists 
and dental hygienists in Missouri. Through meticulous examination, we've outlined their 
geographical distribution and their proximity to rural areas.

This culmination of analytical work aims to facilitate future 
decision-making processes and furnish stakeholders with crucial insights.

Across Missouri, access to dental care faces significant challenges due to provider shortages 
dispersed throughout the state. These shortages have profound implications, leading to 
prevalent issues such as cavities, periodontal diseases, and their consequential impacts on 
systemic health, including diabetes, heart disease, and oral cancer.

With this dashboard, we strive to provide a clear understanding of these barriers, 
highlighting the importance of addressing provider shortages for 
better healthcare access and improved public health outcomes.

##### Unveiling the Dental Health Crisis in Missouri

In the heart of the United States lies Missouri, a state grappling with a silent epidemic: 
poor dental health. Behind the serene landscapes and bustling cities lies a stark reality, 
where access to quality dental care remains a persistent challenge for many residents.

##### Statistics Speak Louder than Words

- According to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, approximately 45% of 
Missourians lack dental insurance, one of the highest uninsured rates in the nation.

- The shortage of dental providers in Missouri disproportionately affects rural areas, 
where over 40% of the stateâ€™s population resides. Access to dental care is limited. 

- Alarmingly, over 25% of Missouri's adults report that they have not visited a
 dentist within the past year, citing cost as the primary barrier.

##### The Hidden Costs of Neglected Oral Health

The repercussions of poor dental health extend far beyond mere discomfort. 
Untreated cavities, gum disease, and oral infections can lead to health issues such as 
diabetes, heart disease, and even oral cancer.

##### Voices from the Heartland

> ***"Forty-two percent of our patients are driving from outside the Columbia area to get work done, 
> because they don't have the dental care that they need provided in the smaller cities 
> that they are from," Parrott, who owns Aspen Dental in Columbia and Jefferson City***

> ***"Taking the time off of work to have to drive further away because we don't 
> have enough dentists in the area to accommodate everyone's needs," Vandelicht, Missouri Resident***

##### Shedding Light on the Path Forward

Amidst these challenges, there is hope. By acknowledging the gravity of the situation and working collaboratively, 
we can pave the way for meaningful change. Through targeted interventions, policy advocacy, 
and community engagement, we can strive towards a future where every Missourian has access to 
the dental care they need and deserve.
